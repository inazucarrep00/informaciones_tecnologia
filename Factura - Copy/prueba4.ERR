Utilice el método AddObject para agregar objetos a un contenedor después de crear el objeto contenedor. Por ejemplo, las líneas de código siguientes crean un objeto Form y le agregan dos botones de comando:
Error in line 5: Unrecognized command verb.
frmMessage = CREATEOBJECT("FORM")
Error in line 7: Statement is not in a procedure.
frmMessage.AddObject("txt1", "TEXTBOX")
Error in line 8: Statement is not in a procedure.
frmMessage.AddObject("txt2", "TEXTBOX")
Error in line 9: Statement is not in a procedure.
También puede utilizar el método AddObject en el código de método de una clase. Por ejemplo, la definición de clase siguiente utiliza AddObject en el código asociado al evento Init para agregar un control a una columna de cuadrícula.
